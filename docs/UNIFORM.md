# UNIFORM — choosing the kit each side wears for a match

> **Status: current** (2026-10-02). SDL builds only: the screen is a JSON menu, which the
> Amiga build does not run, so its button is hidden there.

The PLAY MATCH screen (the team screen before every match: friendly, cup, league, career,
and the online lobby's) has a **UNIFORM** button. It opens SWOS 2020's SELECT UNIFORM screen:
both teams side by side, each with a shirt, shorts and socks, four shirt types, `-`/`+` on
every colour, SWITCH and RESET.

| control | does |
|---|---|
| the four shirt icons | shirt type: plain, coloured sleeves, vertical stripes, hoops |
| `-` / `+` | the shirt's colour, its second colour, the shorts, the socks (ten colours each) |
| FIRE + LEFT/RIGHT on the shirt, shorts or socks | the same, without leaving the drawing; FIRE + UP/DOWN on the shirt is its second colour |
| SWITCH | the team's other kit (its second if it is in its first, else its first) |
| RESET | nobody has chosen for this side: the game dresses it again |
| SELECT | back to the team screen |

## What a choice is

**A choice lasts one match and never touches the team.** SWOS 2020 wrote the kit into the
team's file, which in a career is the team the save keeps. Here it is kept beside the team
(`src/uniform_menu.c`, `Uniform_*`), forgotten when the next match is set up (`SetupPlayers`),
and applied at kick-off: `InitializeInGameTeamsAndStartGame` takes its kits from *copies* of
the two team headers, on which a chosen kit has been written over **both** of that side's kits
(`Uniform_Kits`). Nothing after that reads a kit from a team file — the match, its replay and
a rollback all work from the in-game teams.

**SWOS's own kit rule still runs.** `SetInGameTeamsPrimaryColors` is unchanged and is given
those copies. So:

- A side nobody touched still changes to its second kit to avoid the other's, exactly as it
  always has — including avoiding a kit the other side *chose*.
- A side that chose is dressed in what it chose, whichever of its "two" kits the rule picks.
- Two chosen kits the rule finds too alike are resolved the way it resolves any two: the
  second team gets a one-colour kit. The screen's help line says so while it is the case
  ("THESE KITS ARE TOO ALIKE: THE GAME WILL CHANGE ONE"). SWOS 2020 instead forced both
  sides into what was on screen; that cannot be done online, where each player chooses
  without seeing the other do it.

**The screen shows what will be worn.** A side nobody has chosen for is drawn in the kit the
rule gives it against the other side as it stands (the rule is run on the spot and what it
wrote is put back), so opening the screen and leaving changes nothing. `SWOS.log` has what the
screen showed (`[uniform] …`) and what the match kicked off in (`[match] kits: …`); they are
the same lines.

## Online

In the lobby's team screen only this player's side can be changed; the other's is shown once
they have picked a team. A chosen kit travels **inside the team**: both of its kits become the
chosen one before the team is sent (`lineup_end`), so both machines dress the side from the
same record, the recording's `SETP` carries it, and nothing was added to the lobby's or the
handshake's wire format. The team's own two kits are remembered from when it was picked
(`s_picked`, `src/online_menus.c`) so SWITCH and RESET still have them the next time the
screen is opened.

## The drawings: `[graphics] kit_art = amiga | jaguar`

Default `amiga`; `--kit-art=` on the command line. It is its own setting and does not follow
`sprites`. `src/kit_art.c` draws both:

| | where the art is | how it is coloured |
|---|---|---|
| `amiga` | the MENUS bank: sprites 190-192 (shirt, shorts, socks), 199-202 (type icons) — the EDIT TEAM screen's | one shirt for all four types: its pixels are in eight colours, one per region, and a type is which regions take the second colour (`_shirtTypesTable` / `_shirtsIndexTable`, the same two tables EDIT TEAM uses) |
| `jaguar` | `bin/grafs_jag/JAGKITS.BIN`, cut from `CJCGRAFS_JAGSHEET.bmp` by `scripts/make_jag_graphics.py` (`KIT_BOXES`) | a shirt per type; each colour is four shades, in the kit entries the Jaguar sprites use (240-255) |

The Jaguar's shades need palette entries a menu does not have, so while the screen is up every
team colour's four shades (by `shade_step`) and the icons' sixteen greys are written into
entries 192-247 of the menu palette, which the menus leave unused, and given back when it
closes (`KitArt_Lend` / `KitArt_Return`, around `ShowMenu`, as the credits' photos do).

The Jaguar's drawings are taller (shirt 41 px against 29, shorts 22 against 15, socks 25
against 15), so the screen is laid out for the art in use (`lay_out`). The little player above
each shirt is the stadium screen's (sprites 210-212) in both.

**EDIT TEAM and MY CUSTOM TEAM keep the Amiga's drawings** whatever this is set to: those
screens fit two kits in 160 px, and two of the Jaguar's need 188.

## The button

Entry 68 of `playMatchMenu` — a structural edit of a compiled menu, so it is in
`bin/data_json/menus/playMatchMenu.json`, `Menu_PlayMatch` (`include/menu_data.h`) and
`src/menu_data.c` together, as the CREDITS button was. The bottom row has no room for a fifth
button, so UNIFORM shares EDIT TACTICS' place: the two are stacked, 10 px each, in the 23 the
PLAY button beside them takes; where EDIT TACTICS is not shown (computer v computer) UNIFORM
has the place alone (`UpdateUniformButton`, `src/play_match_menu.c`). It is shown whenever the
screen is about to start a match somebody can still arrange: not while the other team is being
looked at, not before a training match, not when the screen only shows a result.

## Checking it

There is no automated test of the screen. By hand, with `SWOS_KEY_SCRIPT` and
`SWOS_SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL` (docs/MENUS.md §10b) through a friendly: open the screen, leave,
and compare `[uniform]` with `[match] kits:` in `SWOS.log`; then the same after SWITCH on one
side. `bin/SWOS.x86_64 --menu-selftest` covers the menu's JSON.
