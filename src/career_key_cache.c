/* career_key_cache.c — UNTANGLE step 3 / teamSelectionKeyCache cluster Tier 2
 * (overlay retirement).
 *
 * The teamSelectionKeyCache cluster lifted OUT of the careerFileBuffer overlay
 * into a dedicated, bounded buffer. In SWOS2.s (129242-129261) this was one BSS
 * run where the cache OVERLAPPED careerForeignMarketPlayers: the cache builder's
 * overflow bound is `&teamSelectionKeyCacheEnd`, which sat 20014 bytes past the
 * cache start — straight through the foreign-market region. A career-mode
 * 22-byte-slot overflow could therefore stomp live player data (the documented
 * project_cache_overlay_writer_overflow bug). Here the cache gets its OWN
 * buffer and careerForeignMarketPlayers lives in career_foreign_market.c, so the
 * two can never overlap; an overflow now stays in the cache's own dead tail
 * (clamped by the stride bounds-check in the three cache walkers).
 *
 * Buffer size = 8192 bytes: a tight, HONEST bound. The original gave the cache
 * the full 20014-byte span to &teamSelectionKeyCacheEnd (straight through the
 * foreign-market region) as accidental slack; once the two no longer share
 * memory that 18 KB of dead tail only served to SWALLOW a genuine overflow
 * instead of tripping TeamSelectionKeyCache_InsertSpaceSorted's `ptr >
 * &teamSelectionKeyCacheEnd` panic (0x8889) — counter to "panics are signals".
 * The high-water-mark probe measured real usage at ~1188 bytes over full
 * careers, and the analytical heavy case (24-team league + domestic cup +
 * European cup, KEYCACHE_CLUSTER_REWORK.md §8.1) tops out ~2.5 KB. 8192 is ~7x
 * the measured HWM / ~3x the analytical worst case — ample headroom — while
 * making the 0x8889 bound fire loudly on any real overflow rather than eating
 * 18 KB of player-data-free slack first. The 1870-byte save blob (TSKC_SIZE)
 * and the stride-clamped walkers are unaffected (both << 8192). This is the
 * Tier 2 §8.3 finish; the deferred per-record writer fix is still a follow-up.
 *
 * careerJobOfferPhaseBias was byte 1 of the cache buffer in SWOS2.s
 * (`teamSelectionKeyCache: ds.b $1` then `careerJobOfferPhaseBias: ds.b $1`).
 * This is NOT idle memory-reuse: the finance/job-offer code DEPENDS on the
 * overlap value. The cache builder writes entry-0's sortKey to
 * teamSelectionKeyCache[1] == careerJobOfferPhaseBias, so the bias equals the
 * earliest fixture's week — which is the season-start base for
 * lastFinancialWeekIndex (first weekly deduction diff) and the `lastKey - bias`
 * season span in wageScalingDivisor. Promoting it to an independent scalar here
 * decoupled it from the cache, so InitCareer MUST re-derive it explicitly
 * (`_careerJobOfferPhaseBias = ((TeamSelectionKeyCacheEntry*)cache)->sortKey`,
 * career_init.c) — otherwise it stays 0 and the first-match finances are
 * inflated (long-standing bug fixed 2026-07-03). It has its own save descriptor;
 * old JSON saves that carried it as cache-blob byte 1 load it as 0 and it is
 * re-derived on the next season init.
 *
 * Real labels (not .equ) so every reader and the save FX/FA descriptors
 * (addressed by &symbol) keep working unchanged.
 *
 * See project_keycache_cluster_design / docs/KEYCACHE_CLUSTER_REWORK.md.

 * the InsertSpaceSorted overflow bound (== cache + KEY_CACHE_BUF_SIZE). The save
 * already models the two roles as SEPARATE fields (a 1870-B cache blob +
 * a uint16 `team_selection_key_cache_end`), so decoupling the storage is
 * format-neutral; End's address-bound role is re-expressed at the two
 * career_teams.c call sites as `_teamSelectionKeyCache + sizeof(...)`, so the
 * Amiga memory-reuse adjacency is no longer required. The four cursors and
