/* tileagent.h - a Tile Agent map in a game: load it, run it, draw it.
 *
 * Plain C99. No floating point, no 64-bit division, no wall clock, and nothing
 * from the C library but memcpy, memset, memcmp, strcmp and strlen (and malloc/free,
 * unless you pass an allocator and define TA_NO_STDLIB). It plays a map
 * exactly as the editor previews it: tests/runtime_tests.cpp runs this and the
 * editor's own player side by side, frame by frame.
 *
 * docs/FORMAT.md is the format, docs/RUNTIME.md is how to use this.
 *
 *     ta_map *map = ta_map_load(text, length, NULL, error, sizeof error);
 *     ta_player *player = ta_player_new(map, NULL);
 *     ta_player_reset(player, 0);
 *     int goal = ta_map_event(map, "goal");
 *     ...
 *     each frame:  ta_player_advance(player, frame);
 *                  if (scored) ta_player_fire(player, goal, 0);
 *                  for each layer: ta_draw_layer8(player, layer, images, &target, TA_DRAW_ALL);
 *
 * Everything a ta_map points at belongs to the map and is read-only.
